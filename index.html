                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned where current, if not more so, in 
                the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have head some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curiculum and staff didnot disappoint. They where very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommened!"
